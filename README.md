# `minigrep` project from the Rust Book
This is my repo for the project in Chapter 12 of The Rust Programming language
It contains the actual project, plus my own developments.

My own additions:
1. Add support for options (specified with `-` on the commmand line).
2. Add an option `-i` for case insensitive searching (same functionality as environment variable `IGNORE_CASE` as per the project.
3. Add an option `-f` to show the filename as well as the matches.
4. Add functionality to search multiple files (globs work here too).
